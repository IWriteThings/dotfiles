# My Dot Files

This contains my dot files for Unix/Linux/Mac and may also contain
some Windows related items as well if necessary.

## URLS
I have also included a set of URLs that can be accessed from Newsbeuter in
order to stream line my RSS setup. Feel free to edit this file or simply delete
it and replace if you use Newsbeuter as well.
